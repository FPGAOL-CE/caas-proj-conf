***FPGAOL-CE CaaS WebUSB User Guide***

### Guide

### Caution points

- Always, the first from the list of selected USB will be used (instead of the recently-selected one), because of some LibUSB condition. Thus, if unknown devices (Keyboard, Mice, etc) are accidentally selected, the correct downloader may not be used. In this case, press the **"Disconnect all USB"** button, refresh the page, and **"Connect Local USB"** again. 
- The flash chip (NOT the FPGA chip itself) may have limited lifetime. Usually, I'll avoid program to flash too often.
